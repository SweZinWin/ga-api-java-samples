The example uses Java wrapper libraries for both the Analytics Export API and 
AdWords API. Information on finding and installing these libraries can be found 
on Google Code, at the addresses listed below.

There are three things you need to configure in order to get this example running.


1) ANALYTICS API SETUP
- You need to download the Google Analytics Java client library, and reference the 
  appropriate JAR files in your class path.

Detailed instructions can be found here:
http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/2.0/gdataJava.html

Google Data Java client library download:
http://code.google.com/p/gdata-java-client/

In order for the code to run, you'll need to edit a few lines in the sample code to 
include your username, password, and profileID.  The lines will look like:
  private static final String USERNAME = "INSERT_GA_USERNAME_HERE";
  private static final String PASSWORD = "INSERT_GA_PASSWORD_HERE";
  private static final String PROFILE_ID = "INSERT_GA_PROFILEID_HERE";

2) ADWORDS SETUP
- You need to have signed up for API access to your AdWords account, and have an 
  associated Developer Token. If you haven't done this yet, information on how to get 
  started can be found at: 
  https://adwords.google.com/support/aw/adwordsapi/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=15104

- You need to have your Google Analytics and Google AdWords accounts linked and have 
  autotagging enabled.

- You need to download the Google AdWords Java client library, and reference the 
  appropriate JAR files in your class path.

Detailed instructions can be found in the AdWords API Java Client Library Readme:
http://code.google.com/p/google-api-adwords-java/wiki/Readme

AdWords API Java Client Library can be found here:
http://code.google.com/p/google-api-adwords-java/

3) ADWORDS AUTH VIA "adwords.properties"
This sample uses the "adwords.properties" authentication method described in the 
"Basic Usage" section of the Readme page linked above.

This file should be found in the following location, depending on your environment:
OSX / *NIX: ~/adwords.properties
Windows XP: c:\documents and settings\USERNAME\adwords.properties
Windows Vista/7:  c:\users\USERNAME\
